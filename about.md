## Keep Practicing with the IRTG Coding Club!

<p>we hope you enjoyed the Brainhack! If you want to keep practising and to further explore data analysis, we invite you to join the <strong>IRTG Coding Club</strong>. 
  The IRTG Coding Club, organised by students for students, gathers every month to offer support with coding challenges in an easygoing environment. Whether you are new to coding or familiar with it, everyone is welcome to join for a relaxed, question-friendly space to collaboratively address coding issues.
