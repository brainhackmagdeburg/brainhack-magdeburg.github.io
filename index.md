<p style="text-align: center;"> Welcome back to a new edition of Brainhack Magdeburg @OVGU Medical Campus!
<p style="text-align: center;"> <strong> - Registrations are closed - </strong> 

<p> Join the two-day Brainhack event with open-hacking sessions and talks. Choose between <strong> human fMRI, neuronal recording, or protein expression datasets </strong> and work on your analyses in a collaborative environment.</p>

<p> <strong> You are a beginner? Don't worry!</strong> All levels of expertise are welcome! The hands-on sessions are supervised so you can ask questions on your analyses, get feedback, and/or team up with others to address the same challenge.</p>
