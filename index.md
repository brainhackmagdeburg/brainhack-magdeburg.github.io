Welcome back to a fresh new edition of Brainhack Magdeburg!

From the BrainHack organizing team we are happy to present Brainhack Magdeburg 2021. 

Brainhack Magdeburg is part of a larger initiative that holds simultaneous events all over the world with this same goal ([brainhack.org](https://brainhack.org)). A cornerstone of Brainhack is the promotion of responsible research and innovation in an inclusive, open, and transparent manner. Accordingly, knowledge sharing activities and the use of open-source resources are two of the basic tenets of Brainhack.

If you'd like to know more about what the different working groups have prepared for this year's edition, go check out our [schedule](https://brainhack-magdeburg.github.io/schedule/)!
